      <h2>Biryani</h2>
      <p>
        Biryani is a flavorful and aromatic dish that has become a beloved part
        of many cultures, especially in South Asia. It is a fragrant rice dish
        typically made with basmati rice, meat such as chicken, mutton, or beef,
        and a blend of rich spices like cumin, cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves.
        The dish is often layered, with cooked rice and marinated meat arranged
        in a pot, then slow-cooked to allow the flavors to meld together.
        Biryani can also include vegetables, dried fruits like raisins, and
        fried onions, adding both sweetness and texture. The dish is usually
        served with a side of raita, a yogurt-based condiment, or a tangy salad
        to balance out the spiciness.
