      <h2>Football</h2>
      <p>
        Football, also known as soccer in some countries, is one of the most
        popular and widely played sports in the world. It has a rich history and
        a global following, with millions of fans and players across every
        continent. The sport is played between two teams, each consisting of
        eleven players, including a goalkeeper. The objective is simple: to
        score more goals than the opposing team within the allotted time. Goals
        are scored by getting the ball into the opponent's net, which is guarded
        by the goalkeeper. Football is played on a rectangular field, usually
        100 to 110 meters long and 64 to 75 meters wide, with two goalposts at
        either end. The basic rules of football are simple, but the strategies
        and tactics used by teams can be incredibly complex. The game begins
        with a kick-off from the center of the field, and play continues until
        the final whistle. Players primarily use their feet to pass, control,
        and shoot the ball, though they are allowed to use any part of their
        body except for their hands and arms, with the exception of the
        goalkeeper, who is allowed to use their hands within their penalty area.
        The sport requires a high level of skill, athleticism, and teamwork.
        Passing the ball, dribbling past defenders, and shooting at the goal are
        all essential skills that players must master. Teamwork is crucial, as
        success in football often depends on the ability of players to work
        together to move the ball up the field, create scoring opportunities,
        and defend against the opposing team. Defenders work to block and
        intercept the ball, while midfielders control the pace of the game and
        set up offensive plays. Strikers or forwards are primarily focused on
        scoring goals.
