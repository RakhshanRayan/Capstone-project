      <h2>Cleaning room</h2>
      <p>
        Cleaning a room is an essential task that helps create a tidy and
        organized living space. It involves several steps, starting with picking
        up any clutter such as clothes, books, or dishes, and putting them in
        their proper places. Next, dusting surfaces like shelves, tables, and
        countertops removes any accumulated dirt and allergens. Sweeping or
        vacuuming the floor ensures that dust, crumbs, and debris are
        eliminated, followed by mopping if necessary to keep the floor spotless.
        Organizing belongings into drawers or storage bins helps keep the room
        neat, while wiping down windows and mirrors ensures a clean and fresh
        appearance
