      <h2>Badminton</h2>
      <p>
        Badminton is a fast-paced and exciting sport that is played with a
        shuttlecock and rackets. It is usually played indoors, though it can
        also be played outdoors in calm weather conditions. The objective of the
        game is to hit the shuttlecock over the net, ensuring that it lands
        within the boundaries of the opponent's side of the court, while also
        preventing it from landing on your own side.Badminton is played on a
        rectangular court that is divided by a net. The court dimensions vary
        depending on whether the game is singles or doubles, with doubles courts
        being wider and singles courts being longer.

      <h2>Cleaning room</h2>
      <p>
        Cleaning a room is an essential task that helps create a tidy and
        organized living space. It involves several steps, starting with picking
        up any clutter such as clothes, books, or dishes, and putting them in
        their proper places. Next, dusting surfaces like shelves, tables, and
        countertops removes any accumulated dirt and allergens. Sweeping or
        vacuuming the floor ensures that dust, crumbs, and debris are
        eliminated, followed by mopping if necessary to keep the floor spotless.
        Organizing belongings into drawers or storage bins helps keep the room
        neat, while wiping down windows and mirrors ensures a clean and fresh
        appearance
